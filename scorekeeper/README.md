# JS-ScoreKeeper
Keep Score Page Project in Javascript &amp; Bootstrap/jQuery

This game was made based on the Udemy class from Colt Steele, and I feel like I improved upon it and made it better. I added Bootstrap to take advantage of some quick CSS/HTML building as this was also my first project using Boostrap instead of coding everything by hand. 

jQuery is also used to simplify the JS and make it easier to read. 

Enjoy!
